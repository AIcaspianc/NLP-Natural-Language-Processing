## Problem Statement News Article Categorization
# Business Context

In the ever-evolving world of media and news, quickly sorting and managing content is now a crucial strategy. With an overwhelming amount of information, there's a pressing need for effective ways to sort and deliver content to viewers.

As the main conduit for spreading information, the media sector struggles with a relentless stream of news stories covering a wide range of subjects. It's essential not only to ensure that articles are distributed to the appropriate audience without delay but also to keep and captivate viewers in a time when information is abundant.

Challenges Faced by the Industry: In the constant barrage of news, media organizations face issues such as:

Information Overload: The sheer volume of news articles makes manual categorization impractical.
Timeliness: Delays in categorizing news articles can result in outdated or misplaced content.

E-news Express, an emerging news aggregator, is confronted with the task of sorting through its vast collection of news articles. These articles span various categories such as sports, entertainment, and politics, highlighting the pressing need for a sophisticated and automated classification system. The manual process of sorting this wide array of news content is not only time-consuming but prone to human error, risking the company's reputation due to potential mistakes and inaccuracies in article classification. Moreover, the reliance on manual sorting can cause delays and inaccuracies. To address these challenges, the company acknowledges the necessity of implementing advanced technologies, especially machine learning, to automate and improve the sorting of articles.

As a member of the E-news Express data science team, the responsibility involves analyzing the text of news articles to develop an unsupervised learning model that will automatically categorize them. This model's categorization results will be compared with human-assigned labels to assess the AI system's accuracy. The objective is to refine the sorting process to ensure articles are distributed promptly and tailored to the audience's interests.
